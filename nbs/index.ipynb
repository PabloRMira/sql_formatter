    "## Formatting Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the `sql_formatter` is to enhance readability and quick understanding of SQL queries via proper formatting. We use **indentation** and **lowercasing / uppercasing** as means to arrange statements / clauses and parameters into context. By **programmatically standardizing** the way to write SQL queries we help the user understand its queries faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a by-product of using the `sql_formatter`, developer teams can focus on the query logic itself and save time by not incurring into styling decisions, this then begin accomplished by the `sql_formatter`. This is similar to the goal accomplished by the [black package](https://github.com/psf/black) for the Python language, which was also an inspiration for the development of this package for SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize the main steps of the formatter as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each query is separated from above by two newlines.\n",
    "2. Everything but **main statements\\* / clauses** is lowercased\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* Main statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* CREATE ... TABLE / VIEW table_name AS\n",
    "* SELECT (DISTINCT)\n",
    "* FROM\n",
    "* (LEFT / INNER / RIGHT / OUTER) JOIN\n",
    "* UNION\n",
    "* ON\n",
    "* WHERE\n",
    "* GROUP BY\n",
    "* ORDER BY\n",
    "* OVER\n",
    "* PARTITION BY\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Indentation is used to put parameters into context. Here an easy example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT field1,\n",
    "       case when field2 > 1 and\n",
    "                 field2 <= 10 and\n",
    "                 field1 = 'a' then 1\n",
    "            else 0 end as case_field,\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "FROM   table1\n",
    "WHERE  field1 = 1\n",
    "   and field2 <= 2\n",
    "    or field3 = 5\n",
    "ORDER BY field1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a very nice, easy example but things can become more complicated if comments come into play\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Subqueries are also properly indented, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT a.field1,\n",
    "       a.field2,\n",
    "       b.field3\n",
    "FROM   (SELECT field1,\n",

    "        ON a.field1 = b.field1;\n",

    "\n",
    "To setup the development environment:\n",
    "1. Fork this project repository, i.e., click on the \"Fork\" button on the right of the top of the repo page. This creates a copy of the project code on your GitHub user account.\n",
    "2. Clone your forked project from your GitHub account to your local disk and navigate into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/sql_formatter.git\n",
    "cd sql_formatter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Setup the `upstream` remote to be the original project repository (this one and not your forked one):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git remote add upstream https://github.com/PabloRMira/sql_formatter.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Synchronize your master branch with the upstream branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "git pull upstream master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b my_feature_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Install our conda development environment running `conda env create -f environment.yml`\n",
    "7. Activate the python environment using `conda activate sql-formatter-dev`\n",
    "8. Run `nbdev_install_git_hooks`\n",
    "9. Run `pip install -e .` to install the package in editable mode. This way the command line interface (CLI) `sql-formatter` will incorporate your changes in the python code\n",
    "10. When your change is ready commit it, and push it to your fork\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add modified_files\n",
    "git commit -m \"some message\"\n",
    "git push -u origin my_feature_brach\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to create a pull request from your fork.\n",

    "1. Pick an existing issue and write in the comments you would like to fix it\n",
    "  * If your idea is not documented in an issue yet, please write first an issue\n",
    "2. Create a branch from `master` and implement your idea\n",
    "3. Before pushing your solution run first `make prepush` to make sure everything is allright to merge, specially our tests\n",
    "4. Make a pull request for your solution\n",
    "  * The pull request title should be meaningful, something like \"[PREFIX] Title of the issue you fixed\". Please try to use some of the following prefixes: \n",
    "    * [FIX] for bugfixes\n",
    "    * [FEA] for new features\n",
    "    * [DOC] for documentation\n",
    "    * [MNT] for maintenance\n",
